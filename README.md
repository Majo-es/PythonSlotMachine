### Python Slot Machine: Spin for Fun!
This Python program simulates a classic slot machine experience. It allows you to:

- Place your bet: Choose how much you're willing to wager on each spin.
- Pull the lever (virtually!): The program simulates spinning reels with random symbols.
- Match symbols, win rewards!: Depending on the symbols you land, you might win a payout based on a pre-defined payout table.
- Track your balance: Keep an eye on your virtual winnings and losses throughout the game.
